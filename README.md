ML and Data Science Project - Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Dashboard

Objective:
Develop an end-to-end application to 
a. Analyze stock market trends
b. Visualize historical data
c. Predict future prices using machine learning models.

Key Features:

1. Data Collection:
Use Python to fetch real-time and historical stock data through APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.
Store data efficiently using DuckDB or SQLite3.
Data Analysis:

2. Preprocess data using Pandas and NumPy (e.g., cleaning, handling missing values, normalization).
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and seasonal patterns.
Apply statistical models to identify correlations and anomalies.
Machine Learning:

3. Implement predictive models (e.g., LSTM for time-series forecasting or Random Forest for regression).
Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.

4. Data Visualization:
Create interactive dashboards with React.js and D3.js to display:
Stock price trends over time.
Volume, volatility, and moving averages.
Predicted vs. actual stock prices.
Use Plotly or Seaborn for additional visual insights.

5. Web Application:
Build a user-friendly web app with React.js and Node.js for:
Viewing stock trends and analytics.
Allowing users to input stock symbols and retrieve predictions.
Deploy the application using Docker and CI/CD pipelines.
